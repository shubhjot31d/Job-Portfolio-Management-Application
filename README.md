## Job Application Portal for Applicant and Recruiter with Job match analysis

*This is a job application portal where a recruiter can add jobs and positions while an applicant can set up a profile and apply for the job.*  
*This is a user interactive web app*  

Certainly! Here's a brief description for your project that you can include in your resume:

Project Description:
I developed a web-based job application platform that empowers job applicants to create comprehensive profiles, showcasing their contacts and skills. This platform facilitates seamless connections between applicants and recruiters, enabling targeted recruitment efforts. Additionally, applicants can assess their job suitability by obtaining a percentage match for various roles, such as SDE, data scientist, hardware engineer, and management positions. The project was built using a tech stack comprising React.js for frontend development, Node.js for backend development, MongoDB for data storage, and Scikit-learn with the Random Forest algorithm for job matching.

Key Features:
- Profile Creation: The platform allows job applicants to create detailed profiles, highlighting their essential contact information and skills.

- Connectivity: Recruiters can search for and connect with applicants who align with their job requirements, fostering efficient and targeted communication.

- Job Matching: Leveraging Scikit-learn and the Random Forest algorithm, the system provides applicants with a percentage match for various job roles, enabling them to gauge their suitability for specific positions.

Tech Stack:
- React.js: Developed the frontend interface using React.js, ensuring an intuitive and responsive user experience.

- Node.js: Employed Node.js for backend development, handling server-side logic and facilitating smooth API integrations.

- MongoDB: Utilized MongoDB as the database to store applicant profiles, job details, and connectivity information, ensuring efficient data management.

- Scikit-learn and Random Forest: Integrated Scikit-learn with the Random Forest algorithm to analyze applicant skills and match them with job requirements accurately.

This project exemplifies my proficiency in frontend development with React.js, backend development using Node.js, database management with MongoDB, and the implementation of machine learning algorithms for job matching. It demonstrates my ability to deliver user-friendly and scalable solutions while incorporating industry-standard technologies.
